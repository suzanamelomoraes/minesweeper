# Minesweeper

Challenge completed at the last week (week 5) of my foundations program of the Web Development Course at Enspiral Dev Academy, where I needed to create a clone of the desktop game Minesweeper:

The goal of the game is to mark all the mines without setting any off.

I did't need to write the whole game. My primary goal was to learn more about objects and arrays: how to access properties, how to loop through arrays of objects, and so on.

The activity included two JavaScript files with part of the game already provided by the facilitators.

Technologies: 
HTML 
CSS 
Vanilla JavaScript
